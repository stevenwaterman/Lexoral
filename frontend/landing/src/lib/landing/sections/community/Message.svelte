    I've spent my career building software to make people's lives easier at a whole range of big companies.
    So when I saw an opportunity to use tech to help solve a problem close to me, I went for it:
  </p>

  <p class="messageSubhead">I started Lexoral to help with my partner's PhD research:</p>

  <blockquote class="artieQuote">
    <p>
      I'm doing a longitudinal qualitative study, with 20+ hours of participant interviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transcription was always my least favourite bit: it was slow to do manually but none of the alternatives worked for me.
      They don't understand the terminology, wouldn't pass ethics, and locked you in to long-term subscriptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lexoral meant transcripts took an afternoon instead of a week.
      Only having to correct little mistakes meant I was immersed with my participants' stories from the start.

    When I saw my partner struggling with transcribing their PhD research, I knew I had to build Lexoral.
  </p>

  <p>
    I try to be <strong>100% transparent</strong> with the Lexoral community.
    That's why it's open-source, and why I work live on Twitch.
