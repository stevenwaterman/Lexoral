    <summary>Why is it called an accordion menu?</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Because each part of it can expand and contract, like in an accordion.
      If you don't know what an accordion is, just imagine a cute fluffy cat.
      You still won't know what it is, but at least you'll feel better about not knowing.

    <summary>If I use an accordion menu will it make me cool?</summary>

    <p>
      No, not unless you're designing a MySpace profile.
      The <code>{"<details>"}</code> element is cool though, and you can use that for a lot of things.
      I'm using it on this page right below here, to show the code for each example!
