    <h2 id="#what-data">What data do we collect?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information (email address)</li>
      <li>Audio files uploaded to the platform</li>
      <li>
        Metadata provided when you send a request to our service, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>Device signatures (mobile/desktop, browser version)</li>
          <li>When the request was sent</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Any feedback given in user research sessions or online surveys</li>
    </ul>
  
  
    <h2 id="#how-collected">How do we collect your data?</h2>
  
    <p>All of the data we collect is either provided by you directly or provided by your computer automatically when using the website. We collect data and process it when you:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Register an account online</li>
      <li>Upload a new transcript or edit an existing one</li>
      <li>Use the website while logged in to your account</li>
      <li>Voluntarily participate in user research or online surveys</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2 id="#how-used">How do we use your data?</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Secure your transcripts so that only you can access them</li>
      <li>Process your audio files and transcribe them</li>
      <li>Allow you to edit your transcripts</li>
      <li>Debug any issues you are having</li>
      <li>Optimise the platform based on how all of our customers use Lexoral, in aggregate</li>
      <li>Prevent malicious attacks on the platform, to ensure good service for everyone</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>Your data is processed on servers provided by <emph>Google Cloud Platform</emph>. They only access your data when requested by us, as needed to operate Lexoral.</p>
    <p>Lexoral <strong>does not</strong>:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Track you on other websites</li>
      <li>Sell to other companies</li>
      <li>Analyse the content of your transcripts for any purpose, except where you explicitly give permission for a specific transcript to be accessed by tech support in the process of helping you with an issue</li>
    </ul>
  
  
    <h2 id="#how-stored">How do we store your data?</h2>
  
    <p>Lexoral securely stores your data in the cloud using services provided by *Google Cloud Platform*. When not being processed, your data is encrypted and stored on servers in the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>This means that even if someone stole the hard drives with your data on them, they would not be able to read your data. However, your data is not encrypted during processing, nor is it end-to-end encrypted. This means that there are no technical measures to prevent Lexoral from accessing your data, including your transcripts.</p>
    <p>In other words, we are contractually prevented from accessing your data for illegitimate purposes by this privacy policy, rather than being physically unable to read your data.</p>
    <p>Your data is only accessible to users logged in to your account.</p>
    <p>Most processing is performed on servers in the United Kingdom, though this processing is orchestrated using servers in the Netherlands. Your audio and transcripts are processed only within the United Kingdom.</p>
  
  
    <h2 id="#your-rights">What are your Data Protection rights?</h2>
  
    <p>Lexoral wants to ensure you are aware of all your rights when it comes to your personal data. Every user is entitled to:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The right to access</strong> - You have the right to request Lexoral for copies of your personal data. We may charge you a small fee for this service.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to rectification</strong> - You have the right to request that Lexoral correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Lexoral to complete the information you believe is incomplete.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to erasure</strong> - You have the right to request that Lexoral erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to restrict processing</strong> - You have the right to request that Lexoral restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to object to processing</strong> – You have the right to object to Lexoral’s processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to data portability</strong> – You have the right to request that Lexoral transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our email: <a href="mailto:gdpr@lexoral.com">gdpr@lexoral.com</a>.</p>
  
  
    <h2 id="cookies">How we use Cookies</h2>
  
    <p>Cookies are text files placed on your computer which can be read by the websites you visit. Lexoral uses first-party cookies to keep you signed in when you close and re-open your browser. This cookie cannot be accessed by any website other than Lexoral. Lexoral does not use third-party cookies.</p>
    <p>You can set your browser to not accept cookies, or remove them from your browser. However, we do not test Lexoral under these conditions, so the platform may behave unexpectedly.</p>
  
  
    <h2 id="other-websites">Privacy policies of other websites</h2>
  
    <p>The Lexoral website contains links to other websites. Our privacy policy applies only to our website, so if you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy policy.</p>
  
  
    <h2 id="changes">Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
  
    <p>Lexoral keeps its privacy policy under regular review and places any updates on this web page. You will be notified when using Lexoral if the privacy policy has changed, including a link which shows what has changed in the most recent update. If you are unhappy with an update to the privacy policy, you have the right to stop using the service and delete your personal data under GDPR, as described above.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy was last updated on 2021-12-21.</p>
    <p>The table below details the changes to the privacy policy:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2021-12-21:</strong> Previously the policy said that all the data we collect is provided directly by you. This is technically correct but slightly misleading, as we collect some metadata that is provided automatically when you use our website, such as your IP address. Updated the 'How do we collect your data?' section to remove any ambiguity.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
    <h2 id="contact">How to contact us</h2>
  
    <p>If you have any questions about Lexoral's privacy policy, the data we hold on you, or would like to exercise one of your data protection rights, please get in touch by email at <a href="mailto:gdpr@lexoral.com">gdpr@lexoral.com</a>.</p>
