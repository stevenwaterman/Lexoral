<BlogPost id="speaking-with-confidence">
  <p>
    Many of us dread public speaking, whether that means giving a presentation, recording a video, or attending an interview.
    It's incredibly stressful to try and put yourself out there, speaking in front of a group, especially in high-stakes situations.
    I'm the same, or at least I used to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    I seem confident.
    I live-code on stream 5 days a week, I give tech talks, I was even a software consultant advising senior management on technical decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>By default, I'm a shy anxious introvert.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, I've gained confidence speaking.
    Many of the things that helped me, I wasn't doing deliberately - but you <em>can</em> do them deliberately.
    This blog post is all about the things that helped me learn to speak confidently.
  </p>

  <p>
    It needs to be said that my advice in this post <em>isn't</em> going to be applicable to everyone.
    Frankly, a lot of that comes down to the fact that I'm a walking stereotype within my field.
    As a nerdy white man in tech, it's a lot easier to be perceived as confident.
    I'll try and say when a specific bit of advice needs to be seen in that context, but generally you'll need to bear in mind that this <em>my experience</em>.
    The less similar we are, the less useful my advice is.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite all that, I hope that by passing on some of the things that helped me, I can help you.
  </p>


  <h2>Take an Improv Class</h2>

  <p>
    If I had to give one piece of advice, it would be to take an Improvised Comedy class.
    At university, I joined an improv group, even going as far as performing on stage at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
    Out of the things that helped me, this had by far the largest impact.
    You certainly don't have to go as far as I did with it, but there is huge value in taking at least a couple of classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Improv forces you to analyse your body language, voice, and how you present yourself in-character.
    To know if you're portraying a character well, you need to examine how you move and how it affects the way you're perceived.
    Once you get in the habit of subconciously watching your body language and voice, it becomes something you can decide.
    If you can play a confident character on stage, you can play a confident version of yourself when speaking.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's not all about playing characters though - if it was, I'd just tell you to try acting.
    A core aspect of improv is putting you in new situations with barely any time to react.
    Just like when you get asked a question in an interview, you need to think on your feet and take everything in your stride, without breaking character.
    If you get nervous in that kind of situation, improv will force you to get used to it very quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, I think there's an incredible number of benefits to trying improv - I wouldn't be where I am today without it.
    It may seem a little bit weird that I talk so much about playing a character, and how that's useful when speaking in person.
    The truth is, speaking with confidence doesn't actually require you to be confident.
  </p>

  <h2>Start Faking Confidence</h2>

  <p>
    When we say that someone is a confident speaker, we're actually only talking about their actions.
    There are clues, of course, but you can never be sure how someone really feels on the inside.
    If you are incredibly nervous before a presentation, and expertly play a character the entire time, everyone will leave the room wishing they were as calm and confident as you.
    You don't need to <em>be</em> confident, you just need to <em>seem</em> confident.
    <strong>Nobody can read your mind</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why bother though?
    Isn't it pointless to be perceived as confident if you're still nervous on the inside?
    It's time to learn about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">Halo Effect</a>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The tendency for positive impressions of a person, company, brand or product in one area to positively influence one's opinion or feelings in other areas
  </blockquote>
  
  <ul>
    <li>If you appear confident, they'll believe the things you say.</li>
    <li>If you appear nervous, they'll start looking for issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    So how do you <em>pretend</em> to be confident?
    As always, I'd recommend taking an improv class and figuring it out for yourself.
    Despite that, I'm more than happy to share a few of the tips that I learned along the way.
    They mostly focus on breaking social norms, or at least bending them a bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    You need to think carefully before trying any of the things I say here.
    Yes, they do help you appear more confident, but they also make you appear more arrogant and disrespectful.
    It's all situational, and you need to assess how strongly people expect you to stick to the unspoken rules and formalities of the situation you're in.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you reject these social norms, you need the audience to know you're doing it deliberately.
    Otherwise, you just look like you're out of place and don't know what's expected of you.
    With that said, <strong>I need a disclaimer here:</strong>
    You can get away with a lot more as a white male speaker at a tech talk than you can as a young black woman interviewing at an investment bank.
  </p>

  <p>
    So how <em>does</em> a confident person bend the rules?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Don't Dress Up</strong>.
    If you're at an event where you're traditionally expected to be a bit more formal, you can choose not to.
    For example, you can wear your normal work clothes to an interview.
    In many offices, that would be jeans and a shirt, while in tech you could safely turn up in cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt!
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll seem more confident, suggesting that you do this kind of thing all the time and you have plenty of other options.
    Even better, by blending in with the other employees you'll reinforce the idea that you're a good fit, and stand out as a candidate.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Own the Space</strong>.
    When we're nervous, we become physically smaller, crossing our arms and legs, covering our face, and taking up as little space as possible.
    The reverse is true too.
    You hear that advice all the time, to relax and open up your body language, but it goes even further.
    You should be using the entire room:
  </p>

  <p>
    At an interview, get up and start drawing on their whiteboard to explain your point better.
    At a presentation, walk around the room and sit on a table somewhere.
    Show them that the space is yours, you are the center of attention, and you know it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Start Asking the Questions</strong>.
    When you get asked a question, it's very easy to feel like you're back at school taking a test.
    However, a confident person would see that as an opportunity to start a conversation, and open a dialog.
    Ask a follow-up to their question.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're asked how a specific technique works, answer the question and then ask whether it's something they've used before, how their experience was, and whether it's something they'd do again.
    Ask a follow-up to <em>that</em> too!
    They might not have expected the interview to be a two-way conversation, but you've turned the tables and decided for them.
    They'll see you as more of an equal, and think more highly of you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Slow Down</strong>.
    This advice is everywhere, but it bears repeating.
    Nervous people talk too fast, while a confident person knows the value of the things they have to say.
    If the things you're saying are valuable, you should be giving them the time and space they deserve.
    Record yourself practicing and play it at double speed - if you can't understand it easily then you need to slow down.
    That's too slow for the real thing, but you'll go faster due to nerves so it all balances out.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Remember the Human</strong>.
    The <em>people</em> you're talking to are <em>people</em>.
    Treat them as equals, and go in with the mindset that you're there to have a chat with friends.
    They're probably just as fed up with the formalities as you are.
    That's not always the case, but even if they're confused by how friendly you are, it just comes across as confidence.
  </p>


  <h2>Stop Faking Knowledge</h2>

  <p>
    We've discussed the fact that others can see your actions, but not your thoughts.
    Unfortunately, when it comes to factual knowledge, thoughts and actions are the same thing.
    You can't tell someone a fact without knowing it - which means you can't fake knowledge.
    Sure, you could <em>imply</em> that you know a fact without actually knowing it, but that falls apart as soon as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObisQoGN6Cc">ask you directly</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're terrified about getting a question that you can't answer, stop and ask yourself what's going on.
    How much preparation have you done?
    Are there specific areas you don't know well enough?
    Is anyone <em>actually</em> in a position to contradict you?
    By understanding the cause, we can work on a solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If you're under-prepared, or need to revise specific areas</strong>, do more prep.
    That sounds simple, but there's no real alternative.
    The best way to feel calm before some public speaking is to be well-prepared.
    I'm not saying that you need a perfectly polished slide deck, with 50 pocket slides ready to go.
    In fact, many of my favourite presentations have been improvised with a whiteboard and pen.
    It's about having a thorough understanding of the topic, meaning that you can go off on tangents and have productive discussions as a result of questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If you are the expert</strong>, nobody is going to question you.
    If you're there to teach people something, and you know way more about it than they do, then you have nothing to worry about with factual knowledge.
    Don't try and pretend you know more than you do, because nobody is trying to catch you out with trick questions.
    Instead, just share your experience, your knowledge, and your thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If you are the newbie</strong>, be honest about it.
    When someone who is truly confident gets asked a question they don't know the answer to, they just admit it.
    At the start of this post, I confidently told you all about how I'm not a very confident person.
    Counterintuitively, that probably made you think I was more confident, rather than less.
    If you attended a talk and asked someone a niche question, which response would you rather hear?
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    That's a great question, and honestly it's not something I could confidently give you an answer for. Perhaps you could use X? Is this something that you're working on at the minute?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    vs
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I would use X.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Maybe you do prefer the second one, but imagine that you know <code>X</code> is the wrong answer.
    In that case, the first option still makes me think more highly of the speaker, despite them getting the answer completely wrong.
    The second one makes me stop listening.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If it's imposter syndrome</strong>, then it's not really about your knowledge.
    It's an incredibly common experience, worrying that everyone is going to learn that you're a fraud and not as good as you say.
    The topic is far too large for me cover in this post, but I have one piece of advice that could help:
  </p>


  <h2>Nobody Cares About You</h2>

  <p>
    I mean this in the best way possible.
    You can mess up spectacularly - stumble over your words, turn up late, take 5 toilet breaks - and nobody will remember except you.
    If you think that you're significantly worse than everyone else at something, it's because you forget their failures and remember your own.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the absolute worst case, it'll be a funny anecdote about an anonymous person, the details lost to time.
    They had bigger things to worry about, like whether you liked them, what you could see in the background of their webcam, and how long it was until lunch time.
    <strong>You are the main character in your own life, but an NPC in theirs.</strong>
  </p>


  <h2>It's a 5-hour problem</h2>

  <p>
    When the worst happens, and it feels like the world is falling down around me, I have one technique I always turn to.
    I take a moment, collect my thoughts, and ask: <em>'how big of a problem is this?'</em>
    The answer is usually <em>'Huge, life ending, literally the worst thing possible'</em>.
    That's not very helpful, so I ask again with a list of options:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A 5-minute problem</li>
    <li>A 5-hour problem</li>
    <li>A 5-day problem</li>
    <li>A 5-week problem</li>
    <li>A 5-month problem</li>
    <li>A 5-year problem</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By that, I'm asking how long it will be until I don't care about the problem any more, even if the worst case scenario happens.
    The <em>vast majority</em> of the time, it's one of the first two - but no matter what the answer is, it's comforting.
    A 5-minute problem won't matter soon.
    Go have a snack and wait it out.
    A 5-year problem can't be solved in a day, so you need to take a breath, take some time out, and come back to it with a fresh mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    It forces you to stop panicking and put things into perspective.
    If it's a serious problem, it gives you a chance to figure out how you should try and fix it.
    If it's not as serious, it just reminds you that every bad situation <em>will end</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the next time you hear me muttering <code>5 hours</code> to myself, you know why.
    I'm not in a great place, but I'm about to feel a lot better.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Confidently speaking is something I learned, and it's something that you can learn too.
    It takes practice, and it takes a huge amount of self-reflection, but it's possible.
    I suppose the main take-away from this post is that confidently speaking is an action, not a feeling.
    Sure, I do feel more confident when speaking than I used to, and that makes it easier to perform the action of 'speaking confidently', but it's not a requirement.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope this post has helped you, and made it feel like learning to speak confidently is a goal that you could reasonably achieve.
    It wouldn't surprise me if the title of this post was more helpful than anything else.
    A simple reminder that it's all a skill.
    A learned behaviour, something that can be taught, and not just an innate talent that some of us are born with, and some of us aren't.
    If it's something you want to be good at, then practice it.
    You'll get a little better each time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you very much for getting to the end of this post.
    While it's not the kind of thing that I usually write about, I felt like there was a real opportunity to help people.
